# Chatbot-Development-with-RAG-and-Voice-Integration
design and develop a state-of-the-art chatbot featuring Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) capabilities, as well as prompt and voice integration. The ideal candidate will have a strong background in AWS and experience using Bedrock's LLM, along with TTS and STT technologies. Your expertise will help us create a seamless conversational agent that effectively engages users. Join us in pushing the boundaries of AI interaction!
Here's a high-level proof of concept (POC) for integrating your existing chatbot with AWS for data storage and retrieval:

*Architecture Overview*
1. User interacts with the chatbot through a frontend application (web or mobile or link sent as sms).
2. The chatbot uses AI  to understand user inputs and respond accordingly. The interface has LLM selection and voice selection but it will be removed, and my application will be used for settings.
3. User inputs are stored in an AWS database ( RDS).
4. The chatbot retrieves user data from the AWS database using a reference number if it is a previous client or gives a new reference number for a new client.
5. The chatbot integrates with a RAG and prompt system connected to the frontend application via settings.

*Technical Requirements*
1. *Chatbot Framework*: i already have full codes that is functional that uses LLM and voice selection but not refined and not integrated. So i need you to refine my existing chatbot code to integrate with AWS services, you will work with my AWS team and they will help in integration as I already have other AI integrated.
2. *AWS Services*:
    - **: Store user data and conversation history, that will be my AWS team.
    
    - *API *: Handle incoming requests from the frontend application.
3. *Frontend Application*: Integrate with the chatbot using APIs and display chatbot responses.
4. *RAG and Prompt System*: Integrate with the frontend application and provide prompts to the user again I have the application team for that.

*Integration Steps*
1. *Refine Chatbot Code*: Update the existing chatbot code to integrate with AWS services.
2. *work with AWS team*.
3. *Integrate Chatbot with AWS*:
4. *Integrate Chatbot with Frontend Application*: Use APIs to integrate the chatbot with the frontend application for RAG, prompt, voice and llm selection.
5. *Test and Deploy*: Test the integrated system and deploy it to production.

*Reference Number Implementation*
1. *Generate Reference Number*: When a user starts the application, generate a unique reference number.
2. *Store Reference Number*: Store the reference number in the AWS database along with user data.
3. *Retrieve User Data*: When a user returns to the application, use the reference number to retrieve their user data from the AWS database.

*Multimodal Interaction (Text and Voice)*
1. *Text Input*: Handle text input from the user and respond with text and voice output.
2. *Voice Output*: Use a text-to-speech (TTS) engine to generate voice output for user responses.

So I have a full built frontend application for conversation AI. That frontend has LLM and voice selection feature. That frontend is connected with my AWS rds. I just want to use what we currently have but want your expertise for the chatbot AI part of it

This POC provides a high-level overview of the integration process
---------
To integrate the chatbot AI with AWS services, while refining your existing solution to support Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and multimodal interaction (text and voice), we'll focus on:

    Integrating the chatbot with AWS services (RDS) for storing user data and conversation history.
    Enhancing the chatbot with a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mechanism to generate better, more personalized responses by leveraging external data.
    Incorporating multimodal interaction to handle both text and voice inputs/outputs.
    Generating and managing unique reference numbers for users to store and retrieve previous interactions.

Here’s a structured approach and high-level Python code to handle this integration:
Step 1: Refine Chatbot Code to Integrate with AWS

We'll start by assuming that your chatbot has a framework already set up for text and voice generation, but we need to refine it for integration with AWS services like RDS and TTS (Text-to-Speech) / STT (Speech-to-Text).

    Chatbot Architecture Overview:
        The user interacts with the chatbot via text or voice.
        User data (including conversations and reference numbers) are stored in AWS RDS.
        RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is used to augment the chatbot’s responses by pulling relevant data from the database.

    Technologies:
        AWS RDS: For storing user data and conversation history.
        AWS Bedrock (LLM): For large language model capabilities.
        TTS (Text-to-Speech): To generate voice output.
        STT (Speech-to-Text): To convert voice input into text.

Step 2: Code Implementation

Below is a high-level Python-based integration that shows how the chatbot code can integrate with AWS services for storing and retrieving data, including managing the user’s reference number and handling multimodal inputs/outputs.
1. Integrating with AWS RDS (For storing conversation history)

import boto3
import uuid
from datetime import datetime
import openai
from pydub import AudioSegment
import pyttsx3

# Initialize AWS SDK (boto3) for RDS
rds_client = boto3.client('rds-data', region_name='us-west-2')  # Update with your region

# Initialize OpenAI (assuming you're using GPT-3 or GPT-4 for generation)
openai.api_key = "your-openai-api-key"

# Initialize pyttsx3 for Text to Speech (TTS)
tts_engine = pyttsx3.init()

# Helper function to generate a unique reference number
def generate_reference_number():
    return str(uuid.uuid4())

# Function to save conversation in AWS RDS
def save_conversation_to_rds(reference_number, user_input, bot_response):
    sql = """
    INSERT INTO conversations (reference_number, user_input, bot_response, timestamp)
    VALUES (:reference_number, :user_input, :bot_response, :timestamp)
    """
    params = [
        {'name': 'reference_number', 'value': {'stringValue': reference_number}},
        {'name': 'user_input', 'value': {'stringValue': user_input}},
        {'name': 'bot_response', 'value': {'stringValue': bot_response}},
        {'name': 'timestamp', 'value': {'stringValue': str(datetime.now())}}
    ]
    
    response = rds_client.execute_statement(
        secretArn="your-secret-arn",
        resourceArn="your-resource-arn",
        database="your-database-name",
        sql=sql,
        parameters=params
    )
    return response

# Function to retrieve previous conversations from AWS RDS using reference number
def retrieve_conversations_from_rds(reference_number):
    sql = """
    SELECT user_input, bot_response FROM conversations WHERE reference_number = :reference_number
    """
    params = [
        {'name': 'reference_number', 'value': {'stringValue': reference_number}}
    ]
    
    response = rds_client.execute_statement(
        secretArn="your-secret-arn",
        resourceArn="your-resource-arn",
        database="your-database-name",
        sql=sql,
        parameters=params
    )
    
    return response['records']

2. Handling Text and Voice Inputs

For text input, we use the existing chatbot logic with OpenAI or another LLM.

For voice input, we'll use a Speech-to-Text service (such as AWS Transcribe) to convert voice input into text.

import speech_recognition as sr

# Function to convert speech to text using STT (Speech-to-Text)
def speech_to_text():
    recognizer = sr.Recognizer()
    with sr.Microphone() as source:
        print("Please speak now...")
        audio = recognizer.listen(source)
        try:
            text = recognizer.recognize_google(audio)
            print(f"Recognized text: {text}")
            return text
        except sr.UnknownValueError:
            print("Sorry, I couldn't understand your speech.")
            return None
        except sr.RequestError:
            print("Sorry, there was an error with the speech service.")
            return None

# Text-to-Speech (TTS) function using pyttsx3 (for generating voice response)
def text_to_speech(response_text):
    tts_engine.save_to_file(response_text, "response_audio.mp3")
    tts_engine.runAndWait()
    return "response_audio.mp3"

3. Integrating with the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) System

Once the user input is processed, the RAG system will augment the LLM's response by retrieving relevant data from the database. Here’s how you can structure that:

# Function to use RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
def rag_generate_response(user_input, reference_number):
    # Retrieve relevant data from previous conversations or knowledge base
    conversations = retrieve_conversations_from_rds(reference_number)
    
    # Create a context from previous conversations
    conversation_context = "\n".join([f"User: {entry[0]}, Bot: {entry[1]}" for entry in conversations])
    
    # Generate response with OpenAI GPT using the conversation context
    prompt = f"Given the following conversation history, answer the user's query: \n{conversation_context}\nUser: {user_input}\nBot:"
    
    # Generate response using GPT-3/4
    response = openai.Completion.create(
        engine="text-davinci-003",  # Replace with desired GPT model
        prompt=prompt,
        max_tokens=150
    )
    
    bot_response = response.choices[0].text.strip()
    return bot_response

4. Managing Multimodal Interaction

Now we tie everything together with multimodal interaction: combining text input, voice input, and a dynamic, personalized response.

def chat_with_user():
    # Generate a reference number for the new session or retrieve from the user
    reference_number = generate_reference_number()

    # Main loop for text or voice input
    while True:
        mode = input("Choose input mode - (1) Text, (2) Voice: ")
        
        if mode == "1":  # Text input mode
            user_input = input("You: ")
        elif mode == "2":  # Voice input mode
            user_input = speech_to_text()
            if not user_input:
                continue  # Retry if voice input fails

        # Generate response using RAG system
        bot_response = rag_generate_response(user_input, reference_number)
        print(f"Bot: {bot_response}")

        # Convert bot response to speech and play it
        audio_path = text_to_speech(bot_response)
        print(f"Bot's voice response saved at {audio_path}")

        # Save the conversation in the AWS RDS
        save_conversation_to_rds(reference_number, user_input, bot_response)

        # Optionally, ask if the user wants to continue the conversation
        cont = input("Do you want to continue? (y/n): ")
        if cont.lower() != "y":
            break

Step 3: Final Integration

    API Layer: You will need to integrate the chatbot logic with your frontend via APIs. This can be done using frameworks like Flask or FastAPI for creating RESTful APIs to handle requests and responses.
    AWS Lambda: For serverless deployment, you could use AWS Lambda to trigger functions that interact with your RDS, handle user inputs, and serve responses via API calls.
    Frontend Integration: The frontend (web, mobile, etc.) will communicate with these APIs, handling input (text/voice) and displaying output.

Conclusion

This proof of concept (POC) demonstrates the core components of integrating an advanced chatbot with AWS services, such as RDS for data storage and retrieval, along with RAG capabilities for enhanced response generation. We’ve also built in multimodal interaction (text and voice) using Speech-to-Text (STT) and Text-to-Speech (TTS). By combining these elements, your system will have a seamless conversational experience for users across different platforms.

The final integration with the frontend can be managed via APIs, and continuous collaboration with the AWS team will ensure the architecture scales as needed.
